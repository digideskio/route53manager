Route 53 Manager is meant to be running locally, on user's machine, or local
network behind the firewall. It allows you to manage DNS zones and records
for AWS credentials specified in application.cfg
(AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY)

Since you are running the app, you don't need to pass your AWS credentials to
any third party website.

FAQ
===

1. Which Python version is supported by route53manager?

   Flask `documentation <http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/installation/#installation>`_ says that Python2.5+ is required. Some of the plugins might use Python 2.6 specific features, so, recommended version is Python 2.6+.

2. How do I make Route53Manager accessible to requests from other machines on
   my local network?

   By default runserver.py spins a local development server which listens to
   127.0.0.1 IP address, which is not accessible from other machines on your
   network. You can use your machine's IP address (e.g. 192.168.1.15) or
   0.0.0.0 in runserver.py

   ::

       app.run(host="0.0.0.0")

   so your dev server will listen to external requests.

   You can also use some other WSGI server like Gunicorn.

   ::

       pip install gunicorn
       gunicorn route53:app -b 0.0.0.0:8000
